.. This is an include file for Sphinx documentation.  It defines various hyperlinks into the Django
   documentation, which are used within our code documentation.  Because sphinx-autodoc generates
   the .rst files for the source code in PROJECT/docs/modules/ directory, the docstrings in the
   source code use the path "../django-links.rst" for the include directive.
