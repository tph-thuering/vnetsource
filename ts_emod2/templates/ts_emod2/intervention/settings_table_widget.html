                        The day of the event within the simulation. For most events, this will be a
                        one-time distribution beginning on this day. But, within the software, this
                        is simply the simulation time at which the event becomes active and is
                        handled by the Event Coordinator.

                        screen-and-treat interventions. This parameter is used in conjunction with
                        Timesteps_Between_Repetitions.  A value of -1 disables this optional
                        parameter.
