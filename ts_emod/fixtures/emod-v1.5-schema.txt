Two time constants are provided \"primary_decay_time_constant\" and \"secondary_decay_time_constant\". For IRSs, the killing efficacy is governed by the primary decay time constant and the blocking efficacy is governed by the secondary decay time constant. Remember that killing is conditional on blocking, so if blocking drops to zero due to tearing of the net, then no killing will occur, even if killing efficacy is nonzero. DECAYDURABILITY - Both efficacies immediately begin to decay exponentially, with primary_decay_time_constant setting the decay time constant for killing efficacy, and secondary_decay_time_constant setting the decay time constant for blocking efficacy. BOXDECAYDURABILITY - Both killing and blocking have the same durability profile, in which the efficacy remains at the initial level for primary_decay_time_constant, at which point it decays exponentially with the time constant secondary_decay_time_constant.
